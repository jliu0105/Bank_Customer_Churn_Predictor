## Introduction 
Artificial Neural Networks are a type of machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. This project uses an ANN to predict customer churn based on features such as account balance, credit score, age, and more.
### Features 
* Bank customer churn prediction using customer data
* Artificial Neural Networks
* Easy-to-use command line interface

## Requirement
* Python 3.8 +
* Numpy
* Pandas
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-learn
* Keras

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jliu0105/depositor_loyalty_predictor.git
```
